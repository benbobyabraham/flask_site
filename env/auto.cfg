@Ben Boby
Can you add the following documentation to these NBs

c0-module-object-detection
Object Detection Instructional Notebook needs formatted API documentation blocks for these functions:

- readNetFromCaffe
- blobFromImage
- setInput (maybe just a link for this simple function)
- forward (maybe just a link for this simple function)
- NMSBoxes


2. Aruco Markers Notebook needs formatted API documentation block for these functions:
Dictionary_get
drawMarker
DetectorParameters_create
detectMarkers
Just links for: fillConvexPoly, getStructuringElement

Could you create the code for question 12?
